                <h3>1. USER RESEARCH</h3>
              </div>
            </div>


                <p>
To start with the project, user research aims to gather information and discover the problem area in the drone food delivery system. I have interviewed and made an online questionnaire to get the response, interviews are conducted to explore deeper insights from the potential user and gather the concern. Additionally, the online questionnaire aims to get the qualitative response.
</p>

                <p id = "subtitle">in-depth Interview</p>
                <p>
In terms of the interview, I intend to explore the traditional food delivery drawbacks and the opinion of how people perceive the drone to deliver food. Because our group project aims at drone for food delivery, it needs responses from different points of view and people who work in the food delivery industry. I found the useful response from a restaurant owner who runs a Chinese restaurant, he talked about how Uber eats has the problem of delivering food to customer’s door, and they received complaints about some drivers even deliver the food the wrong door. Moreover, I asked general questions from my friend and people who order takeout food often, most of the respondents are excited to see drone delivers the food, it increases delivery speed and quality.
</p>
<p id = "subtitle">Questionnaire</p>
<p>I post the survey online in the Facebook group chat and other social media platforms. I tried to keep the questionnaire question short and to the point, it gathers general concern and aspects that users looking forward to seeing in the app.
</p>
<p id = "subtitle">Persona/ storyboard</p>
<p>To show the narrative of the user experience, I have created 3 storyboards to make comparison of the current experience and the designed experience. It is important to explore how user interacts with the product and to create the visually engaging concept in the different scenario.></p>
<p>After the user research, our team is creating personas to represent the typical users and the goal that they want to achieve. It communicates user needs it is troubleshooting .</p>
<img id = "personaa" src="./img/process-journal/persona.jpg?auto=yes&bg=555&fg=333&text=Third slide" >

<p>In the process of doing the UX research, the most satisfying part is the choice of my research audiences, which includes people from the industry and the potential customers, the customers who are currently using the traditional food delivery show great interest in the new technology, as all the customers craving the new product to improve their experience. In addition, the storyboard I created to show the emotional state of when the user interacts with the product, and the outcome is clear and show the benefits of the solution to the user. Building storyboard imagines the user journey and sketches it out instead of imagining in the mind, it documents the initial idea of the journey.</p>

            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>According to the user research, we found that users are most concerned about the safety of delivery, technical issue, and external constraints. However, most of the respondents are willing to see guarantee the safety of the food in the drone delivery process. And over half of the interviewees have the experience that food is taken by someone else when they food is left in the building lobby. Drone is not capable of recognizing the customer identity and it cannot communicate with the customer like a real human.</p>
<p>Our team brainstormed the solution to the food safety problem regarding food delivery by drone, and to compare the feasibility of each solution, after listing the pros and cons of each solution, it gives us clearer overview of each solution. For example, we came up with the idea that customer can pick up the food with security code which the application generated for each order and then enter it on the drone screen. This is a good way to secure the food and solve the problem that drone is not capable of confirming the identity of customer as it is an autonomous machine. However, entering the correct the security code might be an annoying process as users do not like the complex process to get the food.</p>
<p>Three possible solutions to the problem.</p>
<ul>

<li>1.	entering security code on the drone screen</li>
<li>2.	drone scan the QR code to confirm the identity</li>
<li>3.	Drone leave the food into the designated locker</li>
</ul>

                <h3>the hand-drawn sketch</h3>
                <p>The hand-drawn sketch explores ideas and communicates the solution to the food delivery and the interface. To test the acceptability of each solution, we drew out some hand-sketches of APP interface and test out with potential users. </p>
                <p>Define the basic navigation: home, restaurant, order, track. We drew out the simple icon represents the navigation, and test out if users can fully understand what each navigation icon stands for.</p>

              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>Most of the users like the idea of scanning QR code from the drone screen, because entering security code is annoying and they do not want to re-enter it if they enter it wrong in the first time. Some respondents point out that approach their fingers to the drone screen might be dangerous. Also, the interface looks messy in terms of entering the security code. In this case, entering security code can be annoying process to the user to secure the food. Therefore, scan QR code and collect the food directly from the drone helps with securing food.</p>

            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>According to the initial feedback, we decided to incorporate two ideas, which is scanning QR code to collect the food from drone directly and collecting the food from the locker when the user is not home. Therefore, the solution is beneficial to the users as it is flexible for the user to manage the time to collect the food and it contributes to food security.</p>
                <p> After defining the solution, we start wireframing, the digital wireframe is a detailed version of hand-drawn wireframes. It basically combines the hand-sketched two ideas in the interface, with the real icon and final layout. The user will be able to select the restaurant and order food in the app. In the track order page, there is a line separates two sections of the screen, and the user can drag up and down to make one screen full screen, also, there is a button on the line with up and down arrow, where the user can click it to zoom in and out.</p>

                <p>We applied three user evaluation method to gather feedback from the users.
<p>Usability testing </p>
<p>By setting the specific task to the user and observe how they complete tasks with levels of difficulty. It turns out that most of the participants can understand the icon and the flow easily, they have no difficulty conducting tasks like order a pasta from the Italian restaurant and track the order.</p>
<p>Heuristic Evaluation(Expert)</p>
<p>To gain insights from experts, the wireframe is being tested by design computing students. I intend to explore if the interface violates the heuristic, the feedback recommends us focus more on“Help and documentation” part, where users might need help when they have problems.

            <div class="row">

                <p>For the future improvements, the user experience can be improved by adding more functions to the locker, the locker can maintain the temperature and keep the freshness of the food. Moreover, optimizing the container space of drone is also being considered.</p>
<p>
I am satisfied with the part that we use different evaluation method to test the acceptability of the approach, especially usability testing. Usability testing examines the real-life condition with potential users

            <div class="row">

                <p>Improvement: to enable the user to track the food with clarity, in the track order page, there’s a real-time thumbnail image showing the current state of drone.
In the track order page, a small button is added to combine two sections of information in one screen, there’s real-time travel route of drone on the upper side which the user can zoom out and get clearer information; Moreover, on the lower side, there’s order information. The small button can be dragged up and down to show each section in full screen and it gives user broader view. Users can also change their mind any time of how they want to collect the food in track order page.

              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>After refining the final layout and the flow of the user interface, we focus on the aesthetics of the interface, which is the graphics. To keep the consistency of the interface, the theme color is defined yellow, which is a delightful color and good for eating. Gradient yellow is used for all the clickable buttons throughout the whole interface.</p>
                <p>The final concept is to combine the idea of collecting food directly from the drone and putting the food in the locker. Users will be able to choose how they would like to collect the food in the “confirm order page”, and they can change their decision anytime in the track order page. </p>
<img  id = "interface" src="./img/process-journal/interface.jpg"></img>
                <p> We also add animation to connect each screen, it grasps the user flow and make the app fun and visually appealing, however, I would go about more consistent animation next time.</p>
